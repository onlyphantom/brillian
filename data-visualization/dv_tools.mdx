#### Python
In Python there are several visualization packages, in this section, I'll try to explain to you the packages that I usually used, which is Matplotlib. 

##### Matplotlib
In the Data Analysis with Pandas section, all of you must already know about the pandas as how to gather data with API in Python. In this section, at first we need to gather the data using the API key that you've obtained from sectors.app.

For a context, in this part we will analyze the price of TLKM.JK after Starlink announce their operation in Indonesia

```python
import pandas as pd
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
import requests

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_daily_hist = pd.DataFrame()

api_key = "CHANGE WITH YOUR OWN API KEY"

def get_date_list(start_date):
    start_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(start_date, '%Y-%m-%d')

    end_date = datetime.datetime.today()

    date_list = []

    while start_date < end_date:
        date_list.append(start_date)
        start_date += timedelta(days=90)

    date_list.append(end_date)

    return date_list

date = get_date_list("2024-04-01")

for i in ["TLKM.JK"]:
    for j in range (0,len(date)-1):
        if j==0:
            start_date = date[j]
            start_date = start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
            
            end_date = date[j+1]
            end_date = end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        else:
            start_date = date[j]+ timedelta(days=1)
            start_date = start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
            
            end_date = date[j+1]
            end_date = end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

        url = f"https://api.sectors.app/v1/daily/{i}/?start={start_date}&end={end_date}"
        

        headers = {
            "Authorization": api_key
        }

        response = requests.get(url, headers = headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
        else:
            # Handle error
            print(response.status_code)

        df_daily_hist = pd.concat([df_daily_hist,pd.DataFrame(data)])

        print(f"Finsih collect data for stock {i} from {start_date} to {end_date}")
```

Using the code above, we will have a daily transaction data of those 4 companies which we will to do the analysis. Here is the glimpse of the data.

| symbol   | date       | close | volume    | market_cap      |
|----------|------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| TLKM.JK  | 2024-04-01 | 3510  | 248116300 | 347708338470912 |
| TLKM.JK  | 2024-04-02 | 3490  | 233071700 | 345727083479040 |
| TLKM.JK  | 2024-04-03 | 3420  |1502657000 | 338792724561920 |
| TLKM.JK  | 2024-04-04 | 3450  | 205184000 | 348760504795136 |
| TLKM.JK  | 2024-04-05 | 3460  | 116057100 | 339783352057856 |

```python
df_tlkm = df_daily_hist[df_daily_hist.symbol == "TLKM.JK"]

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))
plt.plot(df_tlkm['date'], df_tlkm['close'], linewidth=2)

# Formatting the plot
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('TLKM.JK Daily Price Since 1 April 2024')
plt.tight_layout()
```
Using the code above, here are the result of the plot.

![TLKM.JK Daily price](../images/data-visualization/tlkm_price.png)

```python
# Convert date to datetime
df_tlkm['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_tlkm['date'])

# Define the color change dates
yellow_date = pd.Timestamp('2024-05-02')
red_date = pd.Timestamp('2024-05-19')

# Plotting the data with conditional coloring
plt.style.use('dark_background') 
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))

# Plot each segment with the appropriate color
for i in range(len(df_tlkm) - 1):
    start_date = df_tlkm['date'].iloc[i]
    end_date = df_tlkm['date'].iloc[i + 1]
    if end_date > red_date:
        color = 'red'
    elif end_date > yellow_date:
        color = 'yellow'
    else:
        color = 'white'
    
    plt.plot(df_tlkm['date'].iloc[i:i+2], df_tlkm['close'].iloc[i:i+2], color=color, linewidth=2)

# Formatting the plot
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('TLKM.JK Daily Price Since 1 April 2024')
plt.tight_layout()

# Create custom legend
import matplotlib.lines as mlines

blue_line = mlines.Line2D([], [], color='white', linewidth=2, label='Before Starlink Rumours')
yellow_line = mlines.Line2D([], [], color='yellow', linewidth=2, label="After First Starlink's Rumour News Emerged")
red_line = mlines.Line2D([], [], color='red', linewidth=2, label='After Starlink Official Announcement in Indonesia')

plt.legend(handles=[blue_line, yellow_line, red_line])

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

and here is the plot result of the code above.

## Creating First Visualization in Tableau Public

Before diving into exploring Tableau and its data visualization capabilities, it’s important to familiarize ourselves with some key terms to better understand the platform.

In Tableau, two crucial terms are Worksheets and Dashboards. Unlike Looker Studio or PowerBI, Tableau doesn't allow direct creation of visualizations on the dashboard canvas. Instead, you must first create individual visualizations in Worksheets and then combine multiple Worksheets into a Dashboard. The table below summarizes the differences between Worksheets and Dashboards.

|                         | Worksheets                                                                                             | Dashboards                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | A Tableau worksheet is a single view that contains one type of visualization, such as a chart or graph.| A Tableau dashboard is a collection of multiple worksheets and elements combined into one view.          |
| **Features**            | - **Single Visualization:** Shows one chart or graph.                                                  | - **Multiple Visualizations:** Displays several charts or graphs together.                               |
|                         | - **Customization:** Allows you to adjust colors, labels, and axes.                                    | - **Interactivity:** Links visualizations with filters and actions.                                      |
|                         | - **Interaction:** Includes features like filtering and tooltips.                                      | - **Layout Options:** Arranges visualizations and elements for better presentation.                      |                                                            |
| **Use Case**            | Used to create individual visualizations for specific data analysis.                                   | Used to provide an overall view and interactive exploration of data, ideal for presentations and reports.|

After know the difference between worksheet and dashboard, let's start 
### Importing Data
![Tableau Data Importing](../images/data-visualization/tableau_import.jpeg)
Once you’ve installed Tableau Public, we can open it and load the data. There are severals data type that we can load to Tableau Public. However, since we only use three free version of Tableau, there are some limitation in load data options.
If you want to import csv file, you’ll need to first download the CSV file, and then save it as a text file, click ‘Text File’ in the left menu and open your text file. The new page shows the data preview and the corresponding fields of the dataset.

### Create Visualization in Worksheet

![Tableau Worksheets](../images/data-visualization/tableau_sheets.jpeg)
Tableau has a relatively gentle learning curve. At the top of Tableau, there are areas for columns and rows. 
As the name suggests, we may drag the variables we wish to see in this area. I drag the sub_sector in rows area and sum of the market cap into the marks area to show a table of total market capitalization per sub sector.

![Tableau Table](../images/data-visualization/market_cap_subsec.jpeg)
We can change the type of visualization using the "Show Me" button in the top right of the menu. And in this case, I want to change it into treemap chart. Moreover, you can also change the color, the label size, and other aesthetic setting in this section.
![Tableau Treemap](../images/data-visualization/treemap_viz.jpeg)

Once you finished creating all the chart you want to make, you can create a new dashboard as a canvas or place to combine all the visualization you've made. In the dashboard, you can customize the size of the canvas, and select all the sheets (worksheet or visualization) that you want to show in that dashboard. 
![Tableau Dashboard](../images/data-visualization/blank_dashboard.jpeg)

In our case we only have one visualization and we only select that chart to be shown in the dashboard. However, you can add multiple chart/visualization here, and you can also customize the size of each chart and add some text in the dashboard.
![Tableau Dashboard Fill](../images/data-visualization/visualize_dashboard.jpeg)

## Hands-On practice

After seeing a mini tutorial on how creating a visualization and dashboard in Tableau, now we will directly create a dashboard using actual data. The [dataset](https://docs.sectors.app) can be downloaded from here. For the dashboard that we will create will be like the image below.
