## Welcome to the Brillian DMA Course

Congratulations on taking your first step towards becoming a brilliant data and analytics
professional. 

### Pre-requisites

Estimated time: None to 30 minutes

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine with the 
right privileges. If your machine is issued by your company, you may have to ask your IT
department to grant you the necessary permissions and firewall access.

- [ ] Install Python 3.7 or higher
- [ ] Install Git
- [ ] Install a code editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code, or VSCode for short)

The Python courses will be taught using Python 3.7 or higher. For the most part, if you're
using a version of Python that's slightly older, you should be fine. 

### Tooling and Setup

Estimated time: 45 minutes
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the materials locally">
    Throughout this learning path, you'll be asked to write code and develop solutions 
    to the problems presented. To help you with this, your instructors have developed 
    a set of materials that you can clone and use on your local machine. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="key" title="Set up your environment variables">
    Throughout the course, you'll be working with a variety of tools and services. 
    To ensure that your code runs correctly, you'll need to set up environment variables 
    that contain sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials. 
    
    Follow the instructions in the repository to set up your environment variables. At no 
    point should you ever commit your environment variables to the repository or 
    use them in your code directly.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Perform the exercises in setting up your Python environment">
    Hop to the [following section](#python-programming-environment) to perform the exercises in setting up your Python environment.
    
    Successful completion of this section will ensure that you have the necessary tools and libraries installed to work with Python,
    and that is a good starting point for the rest of the course. 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Python programming environment
To test that you have set up everything correctly, complete the following steps:

Estimated time: 1 Hour
<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull external data into Python">
    1. Use a command prompt or your Terminal to launch your command line interface, then `pip install requests` 
      to install the Requests library.
    2. Type `python` or `python3` to launch the Python interpreter.
    3. Run the following code snippet to pull external data into Python:
    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supertypeai/idx_total_historical_1995/main/market_cap_history.csv')
    print(response.text)
    ```   
     <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
      If the `requests` library is installed correctly, this code should execute without errors, and `response.status_code` should return 200, which is the HTTP status code for a successful request. 
    
      If the requests library is not installed, Python will raise an ImportError, indicating that the requests module is not found.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Sample Output">
      To verify that you've performed the example correctly, the output should resemble the following:
      ```bash
        year,currency,market_cap
        1995,USD,66584940000
        1996,USD,90997080000
        1997,USD,29050020000
        1998,USD,22077860000
        ...
        2023,USD,717936458435
      ```
    </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Applications">
      Reading in data from external sources is a common task in data analysis and data science. By using the `requests` library, 
      you can easily pull data from APIs, websites, and other online sources directly into Python for further analysis and processing.
      
      <Icon icon="question" /> **Did you know?**
      The data you just pulled in the total historical market capitalization of the IDX (Indonesian Stock Exchange) from 1995 to 2023.
      In fact, it is used in this visualization on a financial intelligence app we've built:
        - [Indonesian Stock Market, Historical Size](https://sectors.app/why-indonesia-stock-market)
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>


  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Pandas and Matplotlib">
    - `pandas` is a powerful data manipulation library that allows you to work with structured data in Python. 
    - `matplotlib` is a plotting library that enables you to create visualizations from your data. We'll be using 
    these libraries extensively throughout the Python data analysis courses.
    
    Install these two libraries by running `pip install pandas matplotlib` in your terminal. 
    
    Then, run the following code snippet to visualize the data you pulled in the previous step:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supertypeai/idx_total_historical_1995/main/market_cap_history.csv'
    df = pd.read_csv(url)

    df['market_cap'].plot()
    plt.show()
    ```
    
    <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
      - If the `pandas` and `matplotlib` are installed correctly, this code should execute without errors, and it will 
      use the `matplotlib` library to plot the market capitalization data. Calling `plt.show()` will display the plot in a new window.

      - If `pandas` or `matplotlib` is not installed, Python will raise an ImportError, 
      indicating that the module is not found.
